<h1 id="chaptertitle">Einkorn</h1>
<p>	Einkorn (<i>Triticum monococcum</i>), which means &ldquo;one grain&rdquo; in German, is truly an ancient grain, having been mentioned in the Bible (Foster 2015; Heritage Grain Conservancy 2016). This flavorful grain has more protein, minerals&mdash;like phosphorus and zinc, and essential amino acids than any other wheat, but has slightly less fiber (GrowNYC 2010, 6; Menayang 2016). Although it is now considered a relic crop due to its limited production and low yield, einkorn is experiencing a resurgence in the Northeast region due to the dedication of Eli Rogosa of the Heritage Grain Conservancy located in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>	The story of how wheat came to be begins with wild einkorn – all varieties of wheat are descendants of this ancient grain. It was first harvested in the wild during the late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic Ages, around 16,000-15,000 BC (Heritage Grain Conservancy 2016). Einkorn is the earliest variety of cultivated wheat, having been domesticated approximately 9,500 years ago in southeastern Turkey (Salamini et al. 2002, 431; Faris 2014, 446). The grain spread from the Middle East to southwestern Europe, proliferating in cool, semi-arid climates (Lazor 2013, 176).</p>
<p>	Like other grains, einkorn can be cooked whole or ground into flour. This rich, nutty-tasting grain can be used in cakes, pastries, and bread; however, it can prove difficult to bake with. Einkorn flour absorbs less fat and absorbs liquids more slowly, therefore a straight substitution of einkorn in place of all-purpose flour will not work in your favor – you must strike the right balance of flour, fat, and liquid (Foster 2015).  If you are substituting einkorn for whole-wheat flour, you may need to decrease the amount of liquid by five to ten percent (Heritage Grain Conservancy 2016). When baking bread, be mindful to let your ingredients sit after mixing to encourage absorption, minimize kneading, incorporate gentle folds, and do a slow rise overnight (Heritage Grain Conservancy 2016). </p>
